# OpenNova

Glossary of the project's domain language. Definitions only: what a term *is*, not how it's implemented. Pick one canonical word per concept; alternatives go under _Avoid_. The runtime architecture map lives in [docs/runtime-architecture.md](docs/runtime-architecture.md); the documentation index is [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Layers

The vocabulary for the codebase's own layering (ADR 0016/0028). Dependencies point one
way: shells → the Godot layer (godot/src) → engine.

**Engine**:
The portable, Godot-free C++ core under `engine/` (`base/`, `formats/`, `runtime/`,
`net/`) — the reimplemented NovaLogic engine: format codecs, the world simulation, the
net stack. "The original engine" always means NovaLogic's binary; our engine contrasted
with retail is *the reimpl*. Godot is never "the engine".
_Avoid_: libs (the pre-2026-08 path), core, framework

**The Godot layer (first-class, ADR 0034)**:
`godot/src/` (pure C++ GDExtension bindings) plus `godot/game/` (the game-level
GDScript runtime) — the layer that wires Godot nodes to engine facts. The game
shell consumes it; ONED uses the process and packaging bindings it needs.
_Avoid_: godot/engine (the pre-2026-08 path), engine layer (that word is the
engine's), glue, bindings (only half of it)

**Shell**:
An application front-end over the Godot layer: the game shell (`godot/game/`) and ONED
(`godot/modtools/`). Shells own UI and application flow, never engine behavior.
_Avoid_: frontend, app (in project prose), host (reserved for the game host)

**Simulation**:
The deterministic in-match world state advanced at the 62 Hz tick by the engine's world
systems (WAC VM, BMS events, AI). `Simulation` is the Godot-layer binding that owns it
shell-side; present passes project it onto scene nodes and never mutate it.
_Avoid_: game logic, GameWorld (that is the scene, below)

## Menu UI (MNU)

The vocabulary for NovaLogic's `.mnu` menu system and OpenNova's runtime support for it.

**Menu**:
A single `.mnu` document: one screen or a set of related screens authored together (e.g. main, options, loadout).
_Avoid_: dialog, page, form

**Screen**:
A top-level, full-canvas layout inside a menu. Only one screen is visible at a time; navigation moves between them.
_Avoid_: page, view (when you mean the whole canvas)

**Window**:
Any node in a screen's widget tree, container or leaf (the format element is `<WINDOW>`). A Window is either a grouping container or an interactive widget.
_Avoid_: panel, control (when you mean the tree node)

**Widget**:
A Window of a specific interactive/visual type (button, combobox, table, spinlist...). Use Widget for the typed sense, Window for the raw tree node.
_Avoid_: control, element

**Action**:
A behavior explicitly authored in a `.mnu` file via an `<ACTION>` element. The
retail vocabulary includes screen/menu navigation; showing, hiding, enabling, or
disabling a named Window; pop; URL and form submission; focus/tab operations; and
legacy browser/LAN/application-message operations. Some Actions are completed by
the Menu Shell, but they remain Actions because the Menu authored them.
_Avoid_: command, event, handler

**Command**:
Behavior supplied by the Menu Shell by matching a widget's **name**, rather than
written as an `<ACTION>` (start a mission, apply video settings, quit, commit a
loadout). An Action may also delegate work to the shell; the distinction is whether
the behavior is authored in the Menu or bound externally by name.
_Avoid_: action (reserve that strictly for the `<ACTION>` element)

**Menu Shell**:
The runtime front-end that loads a menu set, drives a live interactive menu, plays its audio, and supplies Commands by control name. The menu counterpart to the world runtime.
_Avoid_: menu host (retired 2026-07), menu manager, controller

**Tab**:
A Window shown or hidden by a sibling button's `window` Action (e.g. the Options panels). Not a widget type, just an authored convention: one button per panel, each `<ACTION type="window">` hiding the siblings and showing its own.
_Avoid_: page, panel (when you mean the toggling mechanism)

## World & NovaWorld

The vocabulary separating the in-game world from the online service. The names collided
historically; they are now distinct.

**GameWorld**:
The runtime world-sim scene (`godot/game/world/game_world.tscn`): terrain,
environment, mission runtime, and audio under one embeddable root. The standalone
game is the sole live mission runtime (ADR 0025). Formerly named `NovaWorld`.
_Avoid_: NovaWorld (that name now belongs to the service), world scene

**NovaWorld**:
NovaLogic's online matchmaking and account service, and our reimplementation of it (`apps/novaworld_server`, `engine/net/novaworld`). Always the service, never the in-game world. It is our NovaWorld server, not an emulator.
_Avoid_: emulator, lobby server

**Gate**:
The first-contact UDP service (`novaworld_gate`, port 7597) that bootstraps a client with the HTTP service URL and the NovaWorld UDP endpoint.
_Avoid_: lobby

**Browser**:
The in-game server list (`novaworld_browser`) populated from the service's GSB/GLB data.
_Avoid_: lobby, server list (in code)

**Wire-compatible / wire protocol**:
Code that produces and consumes the exact byte stream the original game uses, so original
and OpenNova endpoints interoperate: our clients can join original servers, our servers can
serve original clients, and opennova↔opennova works the same way. The protocol witness
record is `docs/net/novaworld-net-re.md`.
_Avoid_: "our own protocol", custom packet format

**Host / Joiner**:
The authoritative side of an in-match session (the **host**) versus a remote peer that
came in through the join handshake (a **joiner**). Under the listen server the host runs
a local client too; "client" survives in wire-protocol prose (retail message names).
This is the ONLY meaning of "host" in this codebase. UI attachment points are
containers, presentation owners are **Presenters**, application front-ends are
**Shells**, the application embedding a portable lib is its **embedder**, and our
engine contrasted with retail is **the reimpl** — never "the host". Enforced by `scripts/lint/host_lint.py`
(code suffixes; Markdown gets a non-failing advisory and `.agents/**` is exempt).
_Avoid_: master/slave, owner (when you mean the host); host for anything that is not
the authoritative session side

**Listen server**:
A host that is simultaneously the authoritative server and a local client. OpenNova's
single-player runs this way — the sim serializes real entity state through the wire codec
and the present pass renders the locally-decoded result, so SP, co-op, and multiplayer
share one replication path (only the transport differs). See ADR 0011.
_Avoid_: standalone server, dedicated server (those have no local player)

**In-match / Matchmaking**:
The two network protocol domains. **In-match** is the 62 Hz game session between a host
and its clients (the wire codec + replication runtime). **Matchmaking** is everything that
gets players INTO a match: gate, browser, accounts, NAT rendezvous — the NovaWorld
service's domain. Code and libs are named by their domain, never bare "net".
_Avoid_: unqualified "net code", lobby (for either)

**Wire codec / In-match session / Match**:
The two stable in-match boundaries and the gameplay model (ADR 0036). The **wire
codec** (`engine/net/npwire`, ADR 0019) is the retail compatibility contract and
encodes/decodes the byte stream; its message catalog is the single source of
truth (ADR 0013). The **in-match session**
(`opennova::inmatch::Session`, `engine/net/inmatch`) owns lifecycle, role,
fixed cadence, retained input, and tick outcomes. The authoritative **Match**
(`world::Match`) owns rules, player/team statistics, clock, winner evaluation,
and the frozen end-round result. `npruntime` and `netsim` are implementation
directories beneath those boundaries, not peer layers or extension seams.
_Avoid_: "the netcode" (name the wire transaction, session behavior, or match rule);
"net seam" / "net runtime layer" as public architecture

**Packet / Draw list**:
A **packet** is wire data — bytes on the network, and nothing else. What a frame
compiler hands a renderer/applier is a **draw list** (`*DrawList` types, "draw-list
order/bounds/diagnostics" in prose). The rearchitecture campaign renamed every render
output to this shape; new render-side "packet" vocabulary is a regression.
_Avoid_: packet for any render/compile output; "draw packet"

**Entity**:
An addressable object in a running world. A Person and a Vehicle are both Entities, but neither term implies who controls it.
_Avoid_: actor, object (when identity on the wire or in the world is meant)

**Person**:
A physical humanoid body. A Person may be controlled by the local human, a remote human, or AI; "Person" never means "NPC" by itself.
_Avoid_: infantry, player entity, soldier (when the physical body is meant)

**Player**:
A human participant in a match. A Player controls a Person and may control a separate Vehicle through a seat relationship.
_Avoid_: infantry, avatar, client (when the human participant is meant)

**Vehicle**:
A carrier Entity with its own physical state. Its driver, controller, gunner, or passenger remains a separate Person.
_Avoid_: player vehicle, mounted player (when the carrier Entity is meant)

**Soldier Class**:
The Player's selected loadout role, such as medic, sniper, gunner, rifleman, or engineer.
_Avoid_: player class, replication class, character identity

**Character id**:
The packed `Avatars.def` nat|div|combo|side word the wire and world/FP composition key on (`npwire/character_id.h`).
_Avoid_: avatar id, skin id, character index

**Placed device**:
A thrown or emplaced explosive converted to its own pool-1 Entity (satchel, claymore, AV mine), replicated via S2C `0x59`/`0x12`.
_Avoid_: deployable, planted explosive

**Controller Kind**:
Whether an Entity's decisions come from the local human, a remote human, AI, or no controller.
_Avoid_: local-player flag, remote flag, infantry type

**Infantry**:
The historical reverse-engineering label for the AI/organic Person compact on the in-match wire. It is a codec name, not a physical kind or controller kind; use Person in domain prose.
_Avoid_: infantry (for every on-foot person), infantry player

**Wire Compact Codec**:
The fixed record body selected while walking an S2C `0x0A` update: Player-Person, Organic-Person, or Vehicle. It says how to decode bytes, not what controls the Entity or how it moves.
_Avoid_: entity class, player class, object type

**Motion Family**:
The physical mover used by an Entity: Person, ground/light/water/air Vehicle, guided, or static. It is independent of wire codec and controller kind.
_Avoid_: net class, item type

**Storage Pool**:
The runtime allocation family encoded in a wire handle's high nibble. It is independent of BMS kind, item type, controller, and compact codec; when retail allocation is unwitnessed, say unresolved.
_Avoid_: infer the pool from the entity kind

**Presenter**:
A runtime node that owns one presentation surface and projects sim or menu state onto
it: `LocalPlayerPresenter` (FP camera/input/viewmodel — every peer runs one for its own
player, joiners included), `GameHudPresenter`, `ArmoryPresenter`,
`DeployScreenPresenter`.
_Avoid_: host, view controller

## 3DI collision authoring

The canonical author-facing names for gameplay collision-volume families in a `.3di` model.

**Generic Collision Box (CB)**:
A general-purpose collision volume.
_Avoid_: generic BVOL, ordinary box

**Ladder Collision (CL)**:
A collision volume authored for a ladder.
_Avoid_: platform volume, seat volume

**Armory Collision Box (CA)**:
A collision volume authored for an armory.
_Avoid_: armory trigger (when naming the authored volume)

**Vehicle Collision (VC)**:
A collision volume authored for vehicle collision.
_Avoid_: damage pass, damage volume

**Blink Box (BB)**:
A convex interior-containment volume authored for a room or enclosed space.
_Avoid_: blink volume, visibility box

**Door (CD)**:
A collision volume authored to activate a door or another door-like moving part.
_Avoid_: destructible-section volume

**Change Team Box (CT)**:
A collision volume whose player activation changes an object's team settings.
_Avoid_: capture-zone volume

**Flag (CF)**:
The project name for the grounded activation volume. The bundled authoring manual
describes its purpose as activating special functions such as FARPs.
_Avoid_: flag collision box

**Player Collision (CP)**:
A collision volume that physically affects players but not AI.
_Avoid_: generic player-only solid

**Damage High / Damage Medium / Damage Low (DH / DM / DL)**:
The three authored contact-damage volume grades, from high through low.
_Avoid_: numbered hurt volume, damage tier 16/17/18

## Products & modes

**Godot product**:
One of the two OpenNova applications built with Godot: the game and ONED. The
separately distributed OpenNova Launcher, backend services, and development tools
are outside this taxonomy (ADR 0015).
_Avoid_: product (when the Godot boundary matters), app (ambiguous), the runtime
(as a product name)

**ONED**:
The developer-facing Godot product for selecting a game-data tree, running it in
OpenNova or staged retail, and stopping the one game process it started. ONED does
not author game data (ADR 0037).
_Avoid_: launcher, editor, OpenNova Editor, modtools (as a product name)

**OpenNova Launcher**:
The separately distributed Windows tray product that directs a stock NovaLogic
installation to OpenNova's NovaWorld service. It is the only product called
Launcher.
_Avoid_: ONED launcher, launcher (when referring to ONED)

**Serve mode**:
`opennova.exe` hosting a match without being a player: the server-options menu path,
runnable windowed or `--headless`. A mode of the game product, never a separate binary,
riding the one in-match seam (ADR 0015).
_Avoid_: dedicated server product, server exe, opennova-server

**Title**:
A NovaLogic game identity (JO, DFX2, BHD...) — near-identical engine skins over different
data and configuration. OpenNova currently ships title-agnostic; per-title products are a
recorded future option, so new code must not hardcode title identity where a named
constant or config read is equally easy (ADR 0015).
_Avoid_: game (when you mean the identity, not the running program)

**Required resources**:
The resource set the engine hard-requires by name at boot (menu set, game strings, music
banks, HUD layout, defs, default world files...). The witnessed enumeration is
`docs/required-resources.md` (landed at ENG-6); the engine manifest derived from it drives
boot validation and defines the minimum game-data tree.
_Avoid_: core assets, base game files

**Promote**:
Reserved for `mission::promote_mission` — spawning a parsed mission into the live world
(entities, AI brains, nav), the IDA-cited spawn path used by the standalone game
and dedicated dev hosts. Other historical uses of the word (old-title format upliftment, 3DI→IR
normalization, fixture curation, code relocation) should be phrased as *migrate*,
*normalize*, *whitelist*, and *move* respectively.
_Avoid_: promote (for anything but the mission→world spawn)

## Runtime presentation

**HUD**:
The in-game heads-up display, laid out by `hudpos.def`. RE record:
`docs/interface/hud-re.md`.
_Avoid_: overlay (that is the debug overlay), UI (too broad)

**Spinmap**:
The heading-up gameplay map element in the authored `HUDSPINMAP*` rect (retail
`HUD_DrawMapOverlay`); our code says minimap (`HudMinimapCompiler`, `minimap_overlay`,
`client_replica_minimap`) — one thing, two words.
_Avoid_: radar, compass (the compring overlay), map overlay (the windowed command map, D-HUD-19)

**HUD declutter**:
The `hud_detail` 0..3 level × hudpos `HUDDECLUT_*` masks visibility system (`huddetail`
cycles it; level 3 blanks the HUD).
_Avoid_: showhud (that cycles the FP-weapon view flags, not the detail level)

**Present pass**:
The per-frame apply step that projects simulation state onto scene nodes
(the native `PresentApplier`). It runs once in the standalone game runtime (ADRs
0006 and 0025).
_Avoid_: render pass, sync pass
